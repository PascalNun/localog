/**
 * Every word the application says, in English.
 *
 * This file is the source of truth for *what strings exist*. Every other
 * language is typed against it, so a key that is missing or misspelled in a
 * translation is a compile error rather than an English word appearing in the
 * middle of a German sentence at run time.
 *
 * ## Why a plain object and not a library
 *
 * An i18n library brings a parser, a plural engine, a message format and a
 * dependency, to solve a problem this application does not have: the strings are
 * known at build time, there are no user-supplied templates, and the only thing
 * genuinely needed is "the same key, in another language, checked". A typed
 * object does that, and a value that needs a number in the middle of it is a
 * function — which TypeScript checks the arguments of, which no message-format
 * string can.
 *
 * ## Two rules for anything added here
 *
 * **Write the sentence, not the fragment.** A key holding "Could not" and
 * another holding "save the file" cannot be translated: languages put the parts
 * in different orders, and some need to know the gender of the noun to write the
 * verb. Every value here is a whole thing somebody reads.
 *
 * **Say what it is for, where it is not obvious.** A translator — including a
 * later reader of this file — needs to know that `preparing` is a button that
 * becomes a label, or that `silentSystem` is shown *during* a meeting and has to
 * be read at a glance.
